Comprehensive Diagnostic Imaging Services

At Auburn Radiology, we offer a wide range of diagnostic imaging services designed to provide detailed insights into your health. Our services include:

1. X-ray Services: X-rays are one of the most common and widely used diagnostic imaging techniques. They are quick, painless, and highly effective for examining bones, detecting fractures, and identifying infections. Our digital X-ray technology ensures that images are captured with high clarity and minimal radiation exposure.

2. CT Scans: CT (Computed Tomography) scans provide more detailed images than standard X-rays. Using advanced technology, our CT scans produce cross-sectional images of the body, allowing for a comprehensive view of internal organs, bones, and tissues. This is particularly useful for diagnosing conditions such as tumours, internal injuries, and vascular diseases.

3. Ultrasound: Ultrasound imaging uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of the inside of the body. It is a safe and non-invasive method commonly used to examine the abdomen, pelvis, and vascular system. Ultrasounds are also essential for monitoring pregnancy and evaluating fetal health.

4. Dental CBCT and OPG: Dental Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Orthopantomogram (OPG) are specialized imaging techniques used in dental diagnostics. CBCT provides 3D images of the teeth, jaw, and surrounding structures, which is invaluable for planning dental implants and assessing complex cases. OPG, on the other hand, offers a panoramic view of the entire mouth, helping dentists to evaluate tooth positioning, jaw alignment, and overall dental health.

5. CT Cardiac: CT Cardiac imaging is a non-invasive way to assess the health of the heart and its blood vessels. This advanced imaging technique is crucial for detecting coronary artery disease, evaluating heart function, and planning appropriate treatments.

6. Guided Injections: Our guided injection services use imaging techniques such as CT and ultrasound to accurately deliver medication to specific areas of the body. This method is particularly effective for pain management, reducing inflammation, and treating musculoskeletal conditions.
